# Maize Composer

Compose music in your browser.

[Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/Costava/maize-composer/blob/master/getting-started.md)

[Run online](https://costava.github.io/maize-composer/dist/)

## Development
After you `npm install`, you can build using `npm run build-dev` or `npm run build-production` (minifies JS and CSS).

Maize Composer depends on the [Band.js](https://github.com/meenie/band.js) music composer interface. Maize Composer uses a similar but different JSON format as Band.js.
